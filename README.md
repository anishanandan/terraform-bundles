v0.13 tag to build a version of terraform-bundle compatible with Terraform v0.13* and so on

# git clone -b v0.12 https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform.git

# cd terraform

Verify that you are on right branch

# git branch

Windows server bundle testing:

Login to the testbox. You need to have admin access before proceeding with the below steps. Please work with desktop team to get the admin access.


Go to the folder C:/Program Files/ and copy the terraform bundles.


Folder structure should be:

C:\Users\gbuama\Hashicorp Terraform 0.14.3\plugins\providers\registry.terraform.io\hashicorp


Set path: 

Use the below command to set the path. If itâ€™s not working because of path limit, try adding it manually to the environment variables.


SetX path "%path%;C:\Program Files\Apache\apache-maven-3.6.1\bin"

Use the below command to set the path for the session:

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Hashicorp Terraform 0.14.3

Create terraform.rc file under :

C:\Users\gbuama\AppData\Roaming


Terraform.rc


provider_installation {
  filesystem_mirror {
    path    = "C:/Program Files/Hashicorp Terraform 0.14.3/plugins/providers"
    include = ["registry.terraform.io/*/*"]
  }
}


For testing create the below main.tf file and 
main.tf and run  it.


terraform {
  required_providers {
    random = {
      source = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.0.1"
    }
  }
}a

resource "random_id" "server" {
  byte_length = 8
}

output "random" {
  value = random_id.server.id
}
